v1.0.0
    - Version published in ISMIR paper
v1.1.0
    - Adding four-note output representation to multitask learning
    - Now the network is capable of predicting 14 tonal tasks
v1.2.0
    - Making the four-note output the default method for reconstructing Roman numerals
    - By default, 8 tasks will be computed
v1.2.1
    - Providing pre-trained model (14 outputs)
v1.2.2
    - Updating pre-processed dataset that works with v1.2.1 network
v1.2.3
    - Introducing the keydistance metric for forcing tonicizations
v1.2.4
    - Extending the vocabulary of PitchClassSets to 121 classes, a more robust vocabulary than PitchClassSets94
    - This means that v1.2.4 is backwards-incompatible with models trained on previous versions
v1.3.0
    - Replacing romanNumeralFromChord with custom chord vocabulary
    - Using this chord vocabulary not only at inference, but for standardizing the input training data
