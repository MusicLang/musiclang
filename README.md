The Python framework to write, analyze, transform and predict music.


What is MusicLang ?
--------------------

MusicLang which simply stands for "music language" is a Python framework
implementing a new language for tonal music.
This language allows composers to load, write, transform and predict symbolic music in a simple,
condensed and high level manner.
MusicLang internally uses  a [LLM (Large Language Model)](https://huggingface.co/floriangardin/musiclang)  to predict what could happen next in a musical score.
This framework is well suited to :
- Generate musical ideas quickly.
- Predict what could happen next in an existing midi file
- Create an interpretable and information rich text representation of a midi file

How to install
--------------

MusicLang is available on Pypi :

```
pip install musiclang
```
    

Examples
---------

1. A hello world example to create a C-major chord in musiclang and save it to midi :

```python
from musiclang.library import *

# Write A C major chord
score = (I % I.M)(piano=[s0, s2, s4])

# Store it to midi
score.to_midi('c_major.mid')
```

2. Create, transform and harmonize a theme quickly : 

```python
from musiclang.library import *

# Create a cool melody (the beginning of happy birthday, independant of any harmonic context)
melody = s4.ed + s4.s + s5 + s4 + s0.o(1) + s6.h

# Create a simple accompaniment with a cello and a oboe
acc_melody = r + s0.o(-1).q * 3 + s0.o(-1).h
accomp = {'cello__0': acc_melody, 'oboe__0': acc_melody.o(1)}

# Play it in F-major
score = (I % IV.M)(violin__0=melody, **accomp)

# Repeat the score a second time in F-minor and forte
score += (score % I.m).f

# Just to create an anachrusis at the first bar
score = (I % I.M)(violin__0=r.h) + score

# Transform a bit the accompaniment by applying counterpoint rules automatically
from musiclang.transform.library import create_counterpoint_on_score
score = create_counterpoint_on_score(score, fixed_parts=['violin__0'])

# Save it to musicxml
score.to_musicxml('happy_birthday.musicxml', signature=(3, 4), title='Happy birthday !')

# Et voil√† !
```

3. Predict a score using a deep learning model trained on musiclang language :
